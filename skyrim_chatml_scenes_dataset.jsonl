Now it should be as simple as..."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "What's the worst that could happen? Well, you could have your mind sucked dry by Hermaeus Mora... but that's supposed to be very rare. Please, go right ahead. I have plenty to occupy me for the moment. Aren't you going to read it?

Don't worry, I'll take careful notes of what happens to you."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam. If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but at least it's finally done."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Oh good. Be sure to say hello to Hermaeus Mora for me, if you see him."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "I have my doubts. But the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now... reduced to this."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "In the old stories, when the Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Nchardak.

Now we can see if we can find a way to get that next cube."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "There's a passage up there. We could reach it if the water level was higher. You must have left a cube in one of the pump control pedestals. If you remove it, the pumps will stop and we'll be able to swim up there."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Unfortunately, each cube we retrieve shuts down the corresponding pumps, raising the water level. We'll have to be careful."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "It looks like we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress. I believe these pillars will activate the pumps for this room, assuming they still work."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. I have one that you forgot to pick up. I hope you didn't leave any others lying around. Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes.

I'm getting tired of wading around in this muck."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "But how to reach it?"}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "I'd guess that must be the pump activator up there."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "You'll need to lower the water level before we can proceed any further.

Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can be on our way."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were here to do all the hard work."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Well, that's progress of a sort. But we'll need all three down at once to get to the pump control. We'll need to get all three of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "I have some cubes I'm sure you're going to need. You'll need the cube I picked up to start all the boilers. I'm quite sure the boilers will not work while they're under water. I thought you understood how this worked by now. The water level needs to be lower for the boilers to work at all. It should now be as simple as using the cubes to turn on the four boilers. As much as I enjoy this place, I'm ready to see if we can actually open the book's protective case. You do still remember why we're here? You need to start the four boilers. Then we should be able to open the book's protective case upstairs. Is there some problem?"}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "With the cubes I retrieved, we should now have a total of five. I hope you haven't left more scattered about. With the cube I retrieved from the pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes - exactly what we need."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Hmm. Still no steam. You didn't remove any of the cubes downstairs, did you? If you removed any cubes downstairs, you'd better go put them back. The boilers won't work if they're flooded, you know. All four boilers need to be working to open the casing. Are you sure you didn't remove a cube from one of the boilers?"}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "The last time I was here, I only explored a small part of the ruins."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more swimming around in this filth."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "That should do it."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential for this kind of dirty, dangerous work."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Look out! Another Steam Centurion!"}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "Follow me."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "As you'll see, that's easier said than done. This way to the boilers."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "So tantalizingly close... But trust me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if it could."}, {"from": "dlc2maleuniqueneloth", "value": "You can see the book right here."}, {"from": "dlc2femaleuniquefrea", "value": "Be careful."}, {"from": "dlc2femaleuniquefrea", "value": "Beware!

You keep trying out the combinations."}, {"from": "maleoldkindly", "value": "Ah, the Hall of Stories. These are found in many ancient Nord tombs."}, {"from": "maleoldkindly", "value": "And the third has something to do with fire.

Astrid, I've been hearing some, er... interesting things, from the others... about what you did when you left the Sanctuary last week... I heard about what happened... Tell me, brother.

A horker, some twine, three wood elves, and a hatchet? Points for creativity, if nothing else. It's the part with the severed head I find most impressive. My compliments. I'm just trying to imagine you hiding inside the body of a mammoth. Bloody brilliant idea. But to be outnumbered twenty to one... You infiltrated the position, eliminated the target, and made it look like an accident. Impressive. I'd say you earned your bonus on that one! To kill triplets, secretly, and then have the whole thing blamed on the mother. Remarkable. It was a suicide mission! Astrid said as much. Yet here you stand, hale and hearty.  By Sithis, you slew everyone! Well, except for that one you kept alive, to serve as witness. Does your wickedness, or your skill, know no bounds?"}, {"from": "femalechild", "value": "Ah, you must mean my little adventure on the ship... Oh, you mean in that manor house? During the thunderstorm? Heh. What can I say? It happened, just like you heard. You're referring to that blacksmith contract? You must be talking about the caravan job... Word certainly travels fast, doesn't it? The temple contract? Well, I certainly won't deny my involvement. He he he he he. The Redoran contract? Yes, you heard correctly. In and out of Vvardenfell in less than forty eight hours."}, {"from": "maleuniquenazir", "value": "It's all thanks to a special technique I developed. I call it the \"Razor-Winged Butterfly.\" I'd teach it to you... but then I'd have to kill you. Romantic, isn't? Like that time we first met. Remember that? Never seen so much blood. Ah, to be young again... Unscrupulous daring. It's why you fell in love with me, my dear. Bah! A child could have accomplished it. Such is the power of the arcane. If you only knew of the spells I didn't use. He he he he he. What? You think me too old, too feeble? There is more knowledge in me than in two of you pups put together. And knowledge... knowledge is my weapon. Once again, you have underestimated me. You see the man, brutish and hulking. But I am wolf as well. Deliberate. Cunning. When I am become wolf, I am treachery incarnate. And then, then... there is no one who can stand between the hunter and his prey. When I first received the blessing of the wolf, my creator gave me a valuable piece of advice. \"Arnbjorn,\" he said. \"Never lose!\" And I never do.  He he. Don't forget that I am Shadowscale. I was, quite literally, born to kill. It was a simple matter, really, when one has mastered the art of camouflage. Scale becomes stone, becomes shadow. Then... death. My greatest challenge was deciding which weapon to use, for I am prone to indecision. Bow, dagger... axe? In the end, I opted for my claws. In truth? It was so easy, I feel a bit guilty. Once again, the sweet, innocent child earned more trust than was wise. You give me too much credit. For how could I fail? I am, after all, just a little girl. What threat could I possibly pose? He he he he he. I am the perfect weapon. My innocent, childish form grants me nearly unrestricted access. Poison or a good bite usually takes care of the rest. I am but a humble instrument of Sithis. Our Dread Father guides me. Therefore, failure is an impossibility. In the end, I relied on a woman's natural weapons - beauty and seduction. The rest was a formality. Though, a rather wet, messy formality... When one can divine the future, success may not be assured... but it can at least be anticipated. It helps that I've already foretold my own death. Yeah, well, don't expect many more stories like that in my future. I'm getting old. Being that amazing takes too much damn effort. Hmph. Been awhile since I've actually cleaved someone in two. Forgot how hard it was to get the scimitar back out. Let that be a lesson to you young pups. There is no challenge that magic cannot overcome. Come now, dear husband. You above all people should know what I'm capable of. Sometimes I just need to remind everyone why I'm the one in charge. I guess I got tired of handing out contracts to everyone else, while I stayed home playing den mother. It was good to get out, and have some fun. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself. But more importantly, I made this Sanctuary some much needed gold. In the end, that's all that matters. Well, I just did what had to be done. Nothing more. Nothing less. I'm just glad I lived to tell the tale. Ah, contracts like that are few and far between, it seems. Makes me long for the old days..."}]}

We'll see if that's true when the Stormcloaks make their move."}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "I'll tell you the same thing I told Skald.

The oafish servant."}, {"from": "malecommoneraccented", "value": "Skald, if you don't mind sir, I have a request."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "You, have a request of me, Bulfrek? This should be interesting."}, {"from": "malecommoneraccented", "value": "Well, I was thinking sir, with the war going on and all. Maybe, I could enlist?

{"conversations": [{"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Exactly, Bulfrek. You always know your place."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Bulfrek, I have an order of swords and armor from the local blacksmith coming here.

We need to prepare for a long struggle ahead."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "You're right. Why dilute the glory with too many souls fighting over it? We'll drive out the Empire and be celebrated as heroes when we win."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "We are poised for glory, Jod. The Empire will never take Dawnstar while every last man, woman, and child here draws breathe!"}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Enough of your dire predictions! We will talk about this another time."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malebrute", "value": "Glory is meaningless if they have no home to return to. I urge you to lower our commitments to the front until I'm sure we're safe."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "You keep pledging more and more of our guard to the frontlines. The way this is going, we won't be able to defend our own borders."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "I won't have you rob our soldiers of their chance to drive out the Empire. I'm done discussing this, Jod. "}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Safety? Don't I have you to handle the town's safety? What is this about, Jod?"}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Nonsense. The best place for our men is driving the Imperials back.

In Skyrim's moment of triumph, just before we cast off the yoke of Imperial rule?"}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "Yes, that's exactly what I'm asking. I'm not a Nord, I'm a Breton, and I have no wish to fight this war."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "I don't think so, Madena. There will be no deserters in this hold, and that's final."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "I told you before, Skald, I have no interest in taking sides in this war. I've no desire to be killed."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Madena, can we count on your spells to assist us in this war? The Empire is bound to bring their battlemages against us."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "What good is a court mage if she refuses to fight? Where's your sense of duty?"}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "When I came here, my only duties were to cure crop diseases and occasionally light a bonfire on holidays. I didn't sign up to kill."}, {"from": "maleoldgrumpy", "value": "Fine, but this isn't over Madena. We'll talk again."}]}

I wish there was something we could do to help him."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "Yes, just this morning. It was from Logrolf. He wrote to thank us for the food we sent."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "Not well.

We'll talk more of this when I come home tonight."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "How are the necklaces selling, my wife? We could make more."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "Humph. Used to be everyone in Markarth wore a necklace showing his home province, from Elsweyr to High Rock to Hammerfell and Cyrodiil..."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "As they always have, along with those crazed Forsworn.

That's in Hammerfell, correct? And you say these bracelets are only worn by the nobility?"}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "They are popular with the nobility there, yes.

No one would ever take me on anywhere else."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "Maybe it's time you quit then."}, {"from": "maleeventoned", "value": "I can't take it anymore, Tythis.

I can't abide Samuel's constant talk of his parents. \"They're coming for me.\" \"This is only temporary.\" The boy must accept his fate. Seven septims are missing from my purse. I know it was Runa. You get those coins back, or by Stendarr, I'll see her rot in the dungeon.  This place is filthy. I've a mind to cancel all town privileges unless those brats start pulling their weight. The stores are running low. We'll need to water down the milk again. Besides, don't want the little darlings getting fat. We haven't had an adoption in months.

To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it."}, {"from": "femaleuniquemaven", "value": "I have payments to make you realize.

I was looking through our books and there's an entry for \"spices.\" Says we spent 300 septims. What is that?"}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "You sure? It was in your handwriting.

{"conversations": [{"from": "malenord", "value": "All right, Delvin. What gives with that case of Shadowbanish you sold me?"}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Sure, it tastes great. Only one problem.

Sorry, you know the rules Vekel. No refunds."}, {"from": "maleuniquedelvinmallory", "value": "What do you mean? That wine tastes finer than anythin' Surilie Brothers ever made."}]}

It killed several soldiers before it departed."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Good. If Riften should fall, it's only right that its leader be spared."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "I want you to speak to the city guard.

How about it?"}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "Shor's crown! There are things ladies like us are supposed to do. We've talked about this... Let me guess.

Do you understand? So please. Be a girl. For me."}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "Fine. You play in the mud, or play with your father's forge, or get into sword fights with your little friend. But this is not over. Oh, Dorthe. You're breaking your mother's heart, you know that? Well.

Draw them in and they will love you for it."}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "That was better Ataf. Add a bit of emphasis on \"Ragnar\" and \"Red.\""}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "All right, let's try something a bit more... fun."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "You see, all you need is a bit of spirit and any song can be made into a classic."}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "That's all for today. You're dismissed."}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "This time let's try \"The Age of Aggression\". I will demonstrate for the class. This time let's try \"The Age of Oppression\". I will demonstrate for the class."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "Not that I mind the break, of course. But, still... I suppose in wartime, people aren't looking to part with their old junk..."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "It's okay, dear. More work than ever down at the blacksmith. We'll make it through, dear. We always do. Who needs customers and their old junk? Father oughtta punch them in the mouth! That'd get people in here!"}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "Sure has been quiet around the shop lately. We hardly ever get new customers anymore."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "If you give me a list, I'll have them delivered to the dock by tomorrow morning."}, {"from": "malecondescending", "value": "I need some things for the ship."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malenord", "value": "Come on, Heimvar. My son could stoke the forge better than you do! You're making progress, Heimvar. But my boy could still work the bellows better than you do!"}, {"from": "maleyoungeager", "value": "Yeah, but can he hammer the anvil for 8 hours straight? Sure, but I bet he can't hold his mead as well as me!"}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Give him time. In a couple years, he'll be the age you were when you started! Right you are! Guess I'll keep training you... for now."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Really? How did we afford that? Besides, I like the gown I already have."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "Madame Endarie insisted. She made it free of charge, in honor of your lenience about last month's rent discrepancies."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "That was suspiciously nice of her. I thought she hated everyone."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "My lady, I'm pleased to inform you that you have a new gown for court, specially tailored by madame Endarie."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "She does, my lady. But apparently, she hates you just a little less than the others."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecommander", "value": "What news have you heard from the war, Irnskar?"}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "I'm not just talking about my subjects. I'm talking about my people: the proud Nords of Skyrim."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "You won't like it, my lady."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "I told you you wouldn't like the news."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "I'm well aware that I won't like it. But it's my duty to keep my people safe. Tell me."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "Possession of the holds change on an almost daily basis, but I can report that Haafingar is still secure. Your people are safe."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malenord", "value": "You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger. I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you helping the Jarl, Solitude would be weaker."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Sir, we can't just keep trading blows with the rebels like this - it's only strengthening their resolve."}, {"from": "maleuniquetullius", "value": "Don't you think I know that? But these commands come straight from Cyrodiil. "}, {"from": "maleuniquetullius", "value": "We must maintain order and put the rebellious Jarls in their place, before we have a full scale war on our hands."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Sir, this is costing lives of both imperial loyalists and Skyrim citizens alike. And it's winning the rebels support where they had none before."}, {"from": "maleuniquetullius", "value": "Your concerns are duly noted, Legate, but unfounded. I assure you, this war will be over in another six months."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Sir."}, {"from": "maleuniquetullius", "value": "Thank you, Legate. In the future, I'll let you know when your opinion is needed."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "You don't think this is a war already? Sir, I..."}]}

Make sure they're distributed as noted."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Understood, sir."}, {"from": "maleuniquetullius", "value": "That is correct. Those orders have been delivered by special courier. I can't trust some of our normal distribution channels."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Sir, these are missing commands for about half of the commanders."}]}

You can trust us!"}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleargonian", "value": "Shoo! Go away! You get nothing from me. You bother me again, maybe you will not walk away. Understand? Sorry, I have everyone I need at the warehouse. Times are tight."}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "Got any work? I ain't begging. I just need a job. Anything."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "I'm afraid \"acceptable\" just isn't acceptable anymore. I'm sure they can spare a few more coins in monthly rent."}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "Yes, brother. I'm sure they'll agree it's a fair price to pay in order to avoid interacting with you on a daily basis."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Sister, how is my fortune coming along?"}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Fair or not, they'll pay it, and that's all I need to care about. Bear that in mind, sister."}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "Profits continue to rise. The warehouse continues to bring in good revenues, and rent on your stores in the Well is acceptable."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "I can commission one from the Radiant Raiment. It won't be cheap, but if you want the best, they're the only choice."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "I swear, those scheming elves charge us twice what anyone else would pay."}, {"from": "femalecondescending", "value": "Of course they do, brother. You keep raising their rent."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "That clumsy maid at the palace spilled wine on my best suit. Sister, I believe it's time for a replacement."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "maleelfhaughty", "value": "Indeed I have, sir. Elven weapons for their armies, sir. Elven material, but poor workmanship, like most of what we get from them."}, {"from": "maleelfhaughty", "value": "As always, lord, your loyalty is a shining example to us all."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Scary, thinking of those boots with an army of Elven weapons at their command. Let's be thankful they're half a world away, eh?"}, {"from": "maleelfhaughty", "value": "Even a fine weapon is only as good as its wielder, sir. But they should fetch a high price from the Imperial army."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Melaran, you lazy milk drinker, have you finished studying the imports from Black Marsh?"}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Right you are, elf! Or even from the rebels, if they've got enough money to make a competitive offer."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malebrute", "value": "Slow, but looking good, sir."}, {"from": "malecondescending", "value": "Slow's the only way to do it! Work too hard and you'll warp the wood."}, {"from": "malecondescending", "value": "How's it coming there, Jawanan?"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malebrute", "value": "Fihada, where did you learn how to make bows so well?"}, {"from": "malecondescending", "value": "You'd make a better Imperial ranger than me. I may have charmed the locals, but my fellow soldiers hated my waggling tongue."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "Wish I could learn some of that charm. I'm just good with bows, not people."}, {"from": "malecondescending", "value": "The same place I learned my charm and quick wits: I used to be an Imperial ranger, my boy!"}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "malebrute", "value": "Rest up, scum. Probably getting executed tomorrow."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "Come now. You'll want to show up in Sovngarde refreshed. You got an eternity of merrimakin' ahead of you. Guess the headsman's been busy with all your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha!"}, {"from": "femalecoward", "value": "Yeah, you said that yesterday."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecoward", "value": "I mean, the Redguards fought off the Aldmeri and the Empire, and now Hammerfell is an independent state. That's all we Nords want for Skyrim!"}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "They aren't my \"people.\" I'm with the Empire because they pay me. And that means I'm out here, and you're in there. So shut up, scum!"}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "Shut up, scum."}, {"from": "femalecoward", "value": "Hey, jailor! What I don't understand is why you're siding with the Imperials."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "I said shut up, scum!"}, {"from": "femalecoward", "value": "So it's okay if your people rebel against the Empire, but not mine?"}]}

You don't want to hear them sing."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Speaking of sounding good, I've heard a couple of your classmates on the street recently."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "Salmon sounds good today."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "Thanks, Aia. That means a lot. Glad to hear it, Aia."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "None of what he collected tasted as good as your Spiced Wine, Evette. I'm still finding your Spiced Wine to be the best drink I've ever tasted."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "Rum from Hammerfell, mulled wine from Daggerfall and the like."}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "Really?"}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "You know, my father collected exotic alcohols. "}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "maleyoungeager", "value": "Naw, mostly just froze."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Brave man, with the Blackbloods out there. Did you catch anything?"}, {"from": "maleyoungeager", "value": "I went out ice fishing a few days ago."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Well, keep at it. The fish have to get to know you before they're willing to bite."}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "maleyoungeager", "value": "My mother always used to say that too."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Fine, Ataf. You should eat some more tomatoes, though."}, {"from": "maleyoungeager", "value": "Um, excuse me. Could I buy two leeks."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Greta is taking it hardest. She won't go to the Temple of Divines anymore."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "I'm sorry about Roggvir. It's a shame, I liked him."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "Do you know I look forward to Burning of King Olaf each year just because of the fire?"}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "A bit of warming wine, Illdi. You know you can't resist."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "Not fair. You're well aware I can't seem to get warm here."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "You don't need my fruit, I've heard when you sing people throw tomatoes at you anyway."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "How about I trade you a song for some fruit?"}]}

That's all I've got."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "I do not like fish."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Jawanan, I don't see you here often."}]}

{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "It's those damned Blackblood Marauders. They're scaring off shipping. One apple. Since the Blackbloods were dispatched I've had good luck getting shipments."}, {"from": "malebrute", "value": "Your fruit are looking a little less ripe today. Your selection looks very delicious. I'll take an apple."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "I appreciate the thought though."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "I don't think he would have wanted your absolution, Rorlund. He worshiped Talos."}, {"from": "maleeventonedaccented", "value": "I wish we could have absolved your brother-in-law of his sins before his execution."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "maleeventonedaccented", "value": "Plenty of ways to worship the Divines as you know."}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "Of course. And I'm sure it's mostly for ceremonial purposes."}, {"from": "maleeventonedaccented", "value": "Ah a few bottles of Spiced Wine should hit the spot."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Perhaps if I were a little more blessed I could afford to give away my fruit. As is you'll have to pay, Rorlund."}, {"from": "maleeventonedaccented", "value": "Perhaps you could spare a tomato for a priest of the Divines?"}]}

Nice to have something happy in the midst of the war."}, {"from": "femalecommoner", "value": "Not too bad. A few of the guests from the upcoming wedding have placed orders. They seem to when you're around Silana."}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "Are your sales going well? I hope the Divines have been keeping you well."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Free of charge for you."}, {"from": "femaleshrill", "value": "Hello, Silana. Would you like an apple?"}, {"from": "femaleeventoned", "value": "That's generous, Jala, but I am happy to pay my way."}]}

He didn't seem the type."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "I'll need a whole crate of fruit. That Varnius Junius went through quite a few of our supplies."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "As you know, Solitude's coffers are much depleted by the war efforts. Thane Erikur, you have a strong head for business. What do you suggest?"}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Simple. Let the Empire fight its own war, with its own funds, and without hijacking our supplies and soldiers. Let Haafingar rebuild."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "This is an unfortunate but unavoidable ebb in revenue. But as long as we continue to support the Empire, our sacrifices will be well rewarded."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "My lady... Surely you're not that naive. Such foolishness would only leave us defenseless. The rebels would storm the palace in an afternoon."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Listen to you, speaking of sacrifice. You've never gone hungry a day in your life, Erikur!"}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "The Stormcloaks only rebel because the Empire uses Skyrim as its personal larder. The more they take, the more support the rebels gain!"}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "And what would my impetuous Thane Bryling suggest, instead?"}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "That is quite enough. Perhaps I will raise these issues when I have an audience with General Tullius."}]}

I know my place, and it's at your side."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "I'm aware of that, Bolgeir, and I appreciate your dedication."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "However, if we lose the war, the guardsmen of Solitude will make little difference in the end."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "Told you that, did he?"}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "I'm sworn to protect you, my Jarl, but I'm the last line of defense."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "The first line is the walls around this city and the men who patrol them."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "Men who, I might add, we're precious short on."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "Yes, I know. The general acted with my blessing."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "It is vital that we bring Ulfric to justice, but that cannot happen until his army of Stormcloaks is defeated utterly."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "We lost another five guardsmen, my Jarl."}, {"from": "malenordcommander", "value": "If General Tullius continues to conscript our men and send them off to battle, we'll have none left to protect the city."}]}

Less commerce means less money and more starving people. And that means more crime."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "The news is the same as it's been for the rest of the war, your grace. Our borders are secure, but at the cost of the guards for our towns and roads."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "Humph. That's only a problem for people who can't afford to hire their own security."}, {"from": "maleslycynical", "value": "I don't see any reason why we'd need them. As long as those dogs stay outside of our borders, we're fine."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "That may well be our only answer. I will empower my Steward to seek out capable individuals to secure Haafingar. Thank you, my Thanes."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "The Stormcloaks are far from the only threat to the hold. The roads are beset by bandits and beasts... and now there's even talk of bloody dragons."}]}
{"conversations": [{"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "Steward, when is my appointment to meet with General Tullius? There are some issues we must speak about."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "I'm afraid he's had to reschedule, my grace. By all accounts, waging war takes his every moment."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "\"Fair\" is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this."}, {"from": "femaleyoungeager", "value": "Again? He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!"}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the emperor. Who you also serve, technically."}]}

My experiments are all I ask for in return."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "On threat of what, exactly? This city wouldn't run without me! Now if you'll excuse me, my work awaits."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them."}, {"from": "femalesultry", "value": "And? I've seen jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the hold's funds are at this time?"}]}

Falk, you've got to do something about this."}]}

However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Speak your mind, Bryling. You're among friends here."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "There's something that's been troubling me, Falk. I am hesitant to share it, but I feel that I must."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more."}, {"from": "femalecommander", "value": "Yes, of course, but Ulfric's message is a powerful one. More of our people flock to his cause every day."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this."}, {"from": "malenord", "value": "And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards."}]}

The Gray Quarter in Windhelm is little better than a slum. It's shameful that the dark elves are made to live that way.

Apparently, the Red Wave has been docked in Solitude for well over a month, and with no sign of shipping out any time soon. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. There were several Khajiit camped outside the walls of Whiterun. Seems they've been traveling around the whole of Skyrim peddling their wares. They seem to think it's at least a dozen, but I'm sure they're exaggerating.
