Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name. So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines. If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject."

It's very... disconnected from the troubles down here. But that's why I couldn't stay, and why I couldn't go back.
